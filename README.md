### Genesis: A Unique Time Series Model for Financial Forecasting

Genesis is a pre-trained time series model specifically designed for the financial markets.

#### Navigate Market Volatility 

Through forecasts over different time horizons, Genesis can deliver real-time insights and an understanding of how prices are changing, enabling users to uncover temporal relationships and dependencies that exist to anticipate market shifts. 

#### Minimum Data Requirements
To generate one-step-ahead forecasts, Genesis requires a minimum of 400 complete OHLC (open, high, low, close) periods of historical data.
